Sphinx and Read the Docs Tips
=============================

I am using Sphinx_, in conjunction with the awesome `Read the Docs`_ documentation building and hosting service,
to document my open source senior project Bemuse.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/
.. _Bemuse: https://gthisub.com/bemusic/bemuse

After fiddling for a couple of days, I have few tips and techniques to share.
Note that I am not a Pythonian, and so my code may not be idiomatic -- I mean, Pythonic.
Feel free to give suggestions and pull-requests.
