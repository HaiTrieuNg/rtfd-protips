Sphinx and Read the Docs Tips
=============================

I am using Sphinx_, in conjunction with the awesome `Read the Docs`_ documentation building and hosting service,
to document my open source senior project Bemuse.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/
.. _Bemuse: https://gthisub.com/bemusic/bemuse

After fiddling for a couple of days, I have few tips and techniques to share.

.. note::
  This is not a pro tip!
  I only use this name because the subdomain "tips" is already used.
  I'm also not a Pythonian; I just found Sphinx to be the right (and superior) tool for the right job.
  Therefore, my code may not be idiomatic -- I mean, Pythonic.
